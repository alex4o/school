The moon was slowly sliding on the sky of the late night, like the hours passing on my clock. I was reading one of my favorite books, and was just about to turn the last page, when I heared a strong cracking noise. I thouth that it could be something from the outside, maybe an animal as no bruglers go this far into the forest. I went to the window and looked to find the source of the noise, but there was nothign. Only the zephyr was slowly moveing the leaves of the trees back and forth. I thought that my brother could have heard the same noise, so I quickly  went to his room and knocked on his door. He frightenedly opend the door and asked me:  
"Did you hear the same noise?"   
"Yes, I started to think that I am crazy. What are we going to do now"  
"It could be anythting"  
"We can not just wait we should go and check."  
"It's dangerous to go alone. Take this." He passed me a tourch.  
"Oh, you are coming with me."  
We went slowly down the stairs. Wehen we were finaly out, the front door slamed. I was thinking "This can not be good". But the thing I saw next was indescribable. It was ... Santa Clous. I couldn't beleve my eyes. He threw a snowbow at me, and a woke up. Tody was christmas but when I talked with my brother he told me that he had the same dreem.
