1. Going on a trip with friends is not an easy task and I would say that it would take a lot of effort to decide where to go and what to do as most people are different and like differnet things. The best destination in my opinion whill be Warsaw. I think that the destination is the best argument, however the way of transport is also importnt. I would approach only my friends because I think that the person that will acompnay you must be someone who is reliable and trustworthy. The thing is that they probably wouldn't like the idea of paying at all so finding the cheapest trip possible will help a lot. The problem is that I am not very good at persuading so the first thing that I will do is to persuade my friend who is good at it so he could help me to persude everybody else. With this done I would need some argmuent to give to my frend and he will help me.

2. Choices are verry important aspec of human lives. Nobody can escape making choices as even doing nothing is a choice. One of the most important choices I made was that of a high school, as this can be crucial for the thing that will come next in life. I enter the High School of Mathematics in Varna which gave me the ground to furder persue education in the UK.
This is important because off all the decisions people make this one has the hightest impact on the futute. I am really happy whit my choice althought I am not in the bast class, this gave me what I needed to succed.
